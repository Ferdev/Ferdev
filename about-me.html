  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p>My name is Fernando Espinosa, and I'm a senior ruby developer based in Madrid, Spain. I've been doing software development for over 14 years. I really love it, and attention to detail and code quality are my main concerns.</p>

  <p>After several years working for a big consultancy company, a few more running my own company and doing freelance work, I've had two great years working with the awesome team at <a href="http://www.vizzuality.com">Vizzuality</a>.</p>

  <p>In my <a href="#portfolio">portfolio</a> you can check a selection of my web projects. If you want to see more, you can take a look to these too: <a href="http://afg.scarmarbin.be/" target="_blank">AFG</a>, <a href="http://methanegashydrates.org/" target="_blank">Methane Gas Hydrates</a>, <a href="http://mapmydata.co/" target="_blank">Map My Data</a>, <a href="http://www.otrobache.com/" target="_blank">Otro Bache</a> and <a href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/" target="_blank">Protected Planet</a>. All of them, projects of <a href="http://www.vizzuality.com">Vizzuality</a>.</p>

  <p>Besides the web projects I've created a few ruby gems: a <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/cartodb-rb-client">ruby client</a> for <a href="http://www.cartodb.com">CartoDB</a>, a geospatial database in the cloud, a <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/cartoset">rails engine</a> to build geospatial-enabled sites easily and, the last one, a <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com">RubyMotion</a> <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/motion-ocr">wrapper for the OCR engine Tesseract</a>.</p>

  <p>I've also created some products in my spare time just by myself. The last one is the <a href="http://www.ikeameter.com">Ikeameter</a>, a tool to help people to choose Ikea furniture using the measures of the gap they want to furnish. Currently, I'm working in the iOS app, entirely developed using <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com">RubyMotion</a>.</p>

  <p>About my skills, I can perform without problems both front-end and back-end development, I love both of them and my knowledge of each of them are comparable. My object oriented background is quite big, as well as my experience working with relational databases (Oracle, Mysql, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2...). Unix administration tasks aren't a problem either.</p>

  <p>In short, so many years in software development is long enough for much. If you want to know my experience with a certain technology, don't hesitate, <a href="mailto:fer@ferdev.com">ask me</a>.</p>

  <p>Oh! I almost forget: I'm a vim enthusiast, and I use it in a daily basis to code, browse the web, to manage
    to-do lists, to write texts, etc. You can check my vim setup and other stuff in my <a href="https://github.com/ferdev">github account</a>.</p>
