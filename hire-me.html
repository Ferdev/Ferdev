  <h1 id="hire-me">Hire me</h1>

  <p>If you need a ruby back-end developer, a front-end guy or an iOS programmer, I may be able to help you.</p>

  <p>First of all, I want to make it clear <strong>I do not work for projects with fixed scope/budget</strong>, because I don't believe in them. I can give you a rough estimate of what a project could cost, but I can't commit to a date because almost certainly I won't be able to fulfill it</p>

  <p><strong>I do iterative development</strong>, and <strong>I commit to</strong> a complete dedication to the project, to daily deploys, to attention to detail and, in general, to deliver a final result that satisfies both client and me.</p>

  <p>There're two ways to work with me:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>For a fixed amount of time</strong>. As it sounds, I'll work with you for a fixed amount of time, in which I'll perform the planned tasks for each week.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>By project</strong>. A number of features will be defined for the project, and a first delivery date will be scheduled (without fixed scope). Once the first delivery is made, if any features still remains and the client wants to continue working in the project, a new date will be scheduled, so on so forth.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>In both cases, <strong>payments will be made weekly</strong>.</p>

  <p>Although <strong>initially my services don't include any kind of visual or user experience design</strong>, and it's preferable that you provide me with it, you can also hire me for this task if you want. But I should warn you: this isn't my speciality, so don't expect the same quality you'll expect from a specialized designer. Anyway, I can offer you this service too.</p>

  <p>For new projects, you must know that for the majority of them <strong>it's imposible to deliver anything of enough quality for development periods below of 6-8 weeks</strong>. Although it will always depend on the project, below this threshold is really hard to guarantee the quality I want to achieve. Therefore if I think the development period is too tight you may not be able to count on me for the project.</p>

  <p>Of course, as I said, this only applies for new projects. If you need me to support a development team, to perform maintenance on an project, or to improve an existing codebase in bad shape, you can count on me for a minimum period of two weeks.</p>

  <p>As for my methodology, I always make <strong>tdd</strong> over the features to be developed, and I like to manage the project with agile tools like "Pivotal Tracker", since they help me to manage both the pace of the project and the client's expectatives.</p>

  <p>If you're still interested in hiring me, that's great! I'll be glad to hear
    about your project. For that, please, <strong><a href="#project-info-form">fill the following form</a></strong>. The more information you provide me about your project, the better my estimation about it will be.</p>
