With this article I'm starting a new series of blog posts about my approach building a new web project from scratch.

Since I'm about to start one, I thought it may be useful for somebody to know the process I'll follow, including design, front-end and back-end development, testing, management and all the related stuff.

I won't be talking about the interns of the project, though. Only about the process, and how I use my own techniques for every single aspect of the development of a web project.

Also, I'm not pretending to give a master class about creating web projects. I just want to share my tips & tricks about web development, how I make things, hoping that it would be useful for somebody.

In the first post, I'll talk about defining the scope of the project, the "minimal-viable-version" and the tools I usually use for this task.
